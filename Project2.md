## **Project 2**
**Part a: Multi Node Multi-threaded Prim's Algorithm**


### Building and Running
- Maven
``mvn clean compile``
- Build and run main in **test** class 

### Overview
This project utilized the producer-consumer concurrent multithread model in JAVA. The model is used to make sure that the producer won’t try to add data into the buffer if it’s full and that the consumer won’t try to remove data from an empty buffer. In the problem of finding MST using Prim's algorithm, the model 


### Future Work
- Continue to improve performance for the Prim's algorithm
- Continue to discover the utility of multi-node implementation of the algorithm
