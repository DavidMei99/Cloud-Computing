## Project 1: 
**Part a: Single Node Multi-threaded Prim's Algorithm**

A Prim's algorithm is implemented with **JAVA** in JDK 11.

### Overview:
Primâ€™s algorithm is one way to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) given an undirected connected graph.
A **spanning** tree contains all the vertices of the graph. MST for a weighted graph is a spanning tree with minimum weight.

### Tests:
**Testcase 1**
