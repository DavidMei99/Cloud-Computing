## **Project 1**
**Part a: Single Node Multi-threaded Prim's Algorithm**

A Prim's algorithm is implemented with **JAVA** in JDK 11.

### Overview
Primâ€™s algorithm is a **greedy** way to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) given an undirected, weighted and connected graph.
An **MST** contains all the vertices of that graph and also achieves minimum weight. In our project, we present two test cases, each of them involving a graph with different scales. The graph is represented by a $|V| * |V|$ adjacency matrix, where |V| is the total number of vertices in the graph. 

### Complexity
Multi-threading is used to improve the efficiency of the Prim's Algorithm. Without such technique, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O(|V|^2)$, where V is the set of vertices in the graph. In our project, we implemented a thread-based class and each of its instances is responsible for partial optimization (find the vertex with minimum weight in a **subset** of remaining vertices). Since all threads process their tasks in a parallel fashion, Prim's Algorithm's time complexity is reduced. The time complexity is
